## What is Theaterpedia?

Theaterpedia is a platform for **theater pedagogy** (Theaterpädagogik) — the art and practice of using theater techniques for educational purposes.

### The Concept

Think of Theaterpedia as **Wikipedia meets regional networking** for theater education:

- **Regional visibility**: Organized by geographic regions across Bavaria (Germany)
- **Event discovery**: Find workshops, courses, and programs in your area
- **Professional networking**: Connect with theater educators
- **Easy booking**: Reserve and pay for programs directly

### The Problem It Solves

Theater educators often work in isolation. Finding the right person for your school workshop or community project typically involves:
- Scattered information across personal websites
- Word-of-mouth through limited networks
- Weeks of waiting for email responses

**Theaterpedia changes this** by making theater education searchable and accessible online — within minutes, not weeks.

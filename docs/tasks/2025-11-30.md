> This file is the starting-point for a workday. It lists important defaults on how to start a day. It contains both single-tasks that need to be managed as well references to other tasking-documents. It will be updated 2-4 times throughout the day. When the day is over the most important achievements will be summarized on the roadmap-document.

## Notes

- Test-driven approach: Write failing tests first, implement to pass
- Version filtering allows incremental implementation verification

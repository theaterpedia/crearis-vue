## Prepared for Tomorrow

### Sunrise Talk Topics
1. **sysreg_config as single source of truth** - main topic
2. Review CAPABILITIES_REFACTORING_PLAN.md
3. Discuss: Transition encoding (bits vs JSONB metadata)
4. Discuss: Project-owner vs record-owner distinction
5. Decide on migration path from utils-driven → table-driven

### Nina Session Prep (Fri 14:15)
- [ ] Workflow 1 (create-and-prepare-a-project) should be testable
- [ ] Test with opus1 test users (Hans/Nina/Rosa/Marc)

## End of Day Summary

**Major Achievements:**
1. StatusEditor + PostStatusBadge fully implemented with 38 passing tests
2. Scope toggles integrated into post status system (bits 17-21)
3. Migration 049 created for draft_review, scopes, and i18n
4. Comprehensive CAPABILITIES_REFACTORING_PLAN.md for sunrise talk
5. STATUS_EDITOR_GUIDE.md enhanced with future planning section

**Key Discovery:**
- REVIEW status (256) is actually draft_review - a subcategory of draft (parent_bit=64)
- This follows the 3-bit-per-category pattern allowing 8 substates per category

**Deferred:**
- DB constraint NOT NULL DEFAULT on posts.status → Tuesday
- StatusConfigPanel wrapper → after capabilities refactoring decision

# Daily Tasks: December 8, 2025

> This file is the starting-point for a workday. It lists important defaults on how to start a day. It contains both single-tasks that need to be managed as well references to other tasking-documents. It will be updated 2-4 times throughout the day. When the day is over the most important achievements will be summarized on the roadmap-document.

## Day Focus
v0.4 implementation - Kanban and special projects.

### Morning: Events State Machine (CORE ENTITY)

> **Key Architecture Insight:**
> Events = the CORE entity. All theaterpädagogik happens as 'event' (in-presence sessions).
> Everything else (projects, posts, images) previews or reflects on events.
> 
> **Project Type Hierarchy:**
> - **'project'** 👑 → First action: Create 2-3 events (KING type, only one with checkout/payment)
> - 'topic' → First action: Create a post (thematic hub)
> - 'regio' → First action: Configure users & projects network (regional hub)
> 
> Without 'project'-type projects and their events, nothing else makes sense.

**Hans provides:** Events workflow prompt (prepared over weekend from Nina session insights)
**AI finalizes:** Apply proven patterns from Wed-Fri (status transitions, owner logic, tasks, visibility)

**Events prompt should cover:**
- [ ] Event states (announced → started → completed → archived?)
- [ ] Who can create/edit events (roles)
- [ ] Relationship to posts/images (before/during/after)
- [ ] Checkout/registration workflow
- [ ] Recurring events?
- [ ] The "reflection" workflow (event → posts/images documenting it)

### Bug Fix (carry-over if not done earlier)
- [ ] **Login verification detection**: Detect when login needs email verification (currently throws error)
  - Show user-friendly message: "Please verify your email first"
  - Handle unverified user state gracefully

## Quick Start
```bash
cd /home/persona/crearis/crearis-vue
pnpm test:v04  # Track v0.4 progress
```
